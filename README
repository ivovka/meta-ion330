This README file contains information on building the meta-ion330
BSP layer, and booting the images contained in the /binary directory.
Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

The first generation ION platform consists of the Intel Atom x30 processor,
plus the nVidia graphic chip.

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  layers: meta
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-intel
  layers: intel
  branch: master

I. Building the meta-crownbay BSP layer
=======================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP tarball from somewhere.

Having done that, and assuming you extracted the BSP tarball contents
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build a ion330
image by adding the location of the meta-ion330 layer to
bblayers.conf, along with the meta-intel layer itself (to access
common metadata shared between BSPs) e.g.:

  yocto/meta-intel \
  yocto/meta-ion330 \

To enable the layer add the following to the local.conf file:

  MACHINE ?= "ion330"

You should then be able to build a ion330 image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-sato

At the end of a successful build, you should have a live image that
you can boot from a USB flash drive (see instructions on how to do
that below, in the section 'Booting the images from /binary').
